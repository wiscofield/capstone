        <h2>2000's design</h2>
        <h3>07/30/07</h3>
        <p>
          The formatting of mid-2000’s gossip blogs was fairly straightforward: one, two, or three columns. A center column displayed posts, side columns displayed tags, contact/site information, and the everpresent glare of mid-2000’s blog advertising, often powered by Flash.<br><br>
          The 2000’s also saw an explosion of interest in design elements like fonts. Through the mid-2000’s, the fonts available for use on the internet were Georgia, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, and Times New Roman. If you wanted to use a different font, you could use an image as text, as the header of this page shows. Other fonts were not available until Typekit (2009) and Google’s font library (2010).<br><br>
          The 2000's were a period of digital revolution, as users began to access sites from their smartphones. Most of the sites referenced here would not have looked good on a phone screen. Resize the window to see for yourself how parts of the site get cut off when the screen display changes.

        <h2>The Rise of the Gossip Blog</h2>
        <h3>07/30/07</h3>
        <p>
          Blogging really got going during the early 2000’s. Xanga, LiveJournal, and Blogger were three big sites, of which Blogger is the only one still relevant to the blogosphere. In 2003, Blogger was released to the public, kickstarting an explosion of small blogs. The timing was perfect-- a year earlier, BlogAds had begun to allow bloggers to monetize their blogs. The 2003 revolution was secured by WordPress releasing their open source code, allowing for easier access to infinite design possibilities.<br><br>
          Gossip has always been popular (see Procopius’ The Secret History), but the forms it has been disseminated have changed throughout the centuries. The first major gossip site, Gawker, was founded in 2003. Gawker was a lucrative business that eventually hired multiple writers… and existed solely on the internet, an innovative concept at the time. Gossip blogs provided a service that had previously been provided by tabloid magazines and newspapers for free.<br><br>
          The power dynamics of gossip blogs-- particularly anonymous gossip blogs-- was explored by popular shows such as Gossip Girl (which first aired in 2007). Could gossip blogs truly curb the power of the rich by subjecting them to constant scrutiny? Probably not. Often the ones writing the most successful blogs were themselves members of the socialite class, whether they chose to make their names public (Perez Hilton) or not (the Rei twins of the short-lived blog Socialite Ranker).<br><br>
          The most important factor pushing gossip blogs to prominence, though, was probably that they were able to react instantaneously to any juicy tidbits they received, making these blogs the most up-to-date sources of any celebrity drama, real or conceived. The demand for celebrity photographs created largely by the “24/7 news cycle” of gossip blogs pushed a spike in paparazzi employment during the 2000’s that was crushed by the rise of social media.
