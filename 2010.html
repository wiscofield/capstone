          Hi! This is a blog that's supposed to look like it's from last decade!
        </p>
        <p>
          I was inspired by fanblogs of the time! A lot of people wrote about things they liked and it was a fun time.
          This one's inspired by a specific wordpress theme called <a href="https://www.themegrade.com/data/004/katana-b.jpg">Katana</a>
          (It no longer exists but that'll link you to a picture), which is for anime fanblogs. This time period was really interesting because
          websites like wordpress and weebly had just come into their own and suddenly you didn't need to know how to program to make a website.
          This took a lot of the customization out of sites, so a lot of them shared the same features (but varying themes/colors).
        </p>
        <p>
          Here's some stuff I wanna point out about this website that I think drives home the aesthetic of the decade.
          <ul>
            <li>
              The corners of the main body section are rounded. That was really popular, probably because it
              had been made MUCH easier by webkit's 'border-radius' CSS attribute in 2005 and gained mainstream support a little later.
            </li>
            <li>
              Box shadows were used to create a sense of depth on the page. If you notice, the curved ends of the box for the posts look like
              they're on top of the others, because they have a shadow effect on the rest of the page.
            </li>
            <li>
              They LOVED putting things in boxes. I'm not super sure why, but most websites had a pretty pointless box, like this one here.
              It kinda looks nice, but it's definitely an interesting way to create whitespace when margins will get roughly the same effect.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          The rest of these posts are just gonna be fun lil' examples of what you might find on a blog like this.
        </p>

              There's this new anime that came out this year called Attack on Titan. I watched a few episodes and it was pretty good. Here's a picture
              of it.

              Attack on Titan is a Japanese dark fantasy anime television series adapted from the manga of the same name by Hajime Isayama. It is set in a
              world where humanity lives inside cities surrounded by enormous walls due to the Titans, gigantic humanoid beings who devour humans seemingly
              without reason. The story follows the adventures of Eren Yeager, his friends Mikasa Ackerman and Armin Arlert, whose lives are changed forever
              after a Colossal Titan breaches the wall of their home town. Vowing revenge and to reclaim the world from the Titans, Eren and his friends join
              the Scout Regiment, an elite group of soldiers who fight Titans. (I copied this from wikipedia for content)
