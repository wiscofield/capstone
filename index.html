      <h2>Welcome to the 1990s</h2>
      <h6>11/8/1998</h6>
      <p>
        Hey guys! Welcome to my 1990s-esque blog. I was inspired by <a href="links.net">Links.net</a>, a blog created in 1994 by Swarthmore student Justin Hall. I also used <a href="web.archive.org">the Internet Archive Wayback Machine</a>. This site lets you type in a URL and track what that website looked like throughout the years. I had fun looking at the early beginnings of Links.net and blogging sites like Live Journal. Most of these early blogs I looked at resembled online diaries; people documented their daily routines, contact info, poetry, and lots of links. If you want to learn more about the history of blogging, <a href="https://themeisle.com/blog/history-of-blogging/">this</a> is a good place to start!

      <h2>My favorite quote right now</h2>
      <h6>9/8/1999</h6>
      <blockquote>
          People of a certain age and level of like life-experience believe they’re immortal: college students and alcoholics/addicts are the worst: they deep-down believe they’re exempt from the laws of physics and statistics that ironly govern everybody else. They’ll piss and moan your ear off if somebody else fucks with the rules, but they don’t deep down see themselves subject to them, the same rules. And they’re constitutionally unable to learn from anybody else’s experience: if some jaywalking B.U. student does get his car towed, your other student’s or addict’s response to this will be to ponder just what imponderable difference makes it possible for that other guy to get splattered or towed and not him, the ponderer. They never doubt the difference — they just ponder it. It’s like a kind of idolatry of uniqueness.
